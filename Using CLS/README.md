# CLS Token in Transformer-Based Classification

## Overview

The Classification Token (CLS) is a special token in BERT-like models used for sequence-level classification tasks. This document explains how we've implemented CLS token handling in our sentiment analysis model.

## Implementation Details

### How CLS Works

1. The BERT tokenizer automatically adds a `[CLS]` token at the beginning of each input sequence
2. This token is designed to aggregate sequence-level information during the self-attention process
3. After processing through transformer layers, the final representation of this token is used for classification

### Previous Implementation Issues

In our previous model implementation:

```python
def forward(self, src):
    embedded = self.embedding(src) * math.sqrt(self.embed_dim)
    embedded = self.pos_encoder(embedded)
    transformer_input = embedded.permute(1, 0, 2)
    transformer_output = self.transformer_encoder(transformer_input)
    output = transformer_output[0]
    logits = self.fc_out(output)
    return logits
```

While the code was using `transformer_output[0]` (which coincidentally is the CLS token position), it wasn't clear that we were intentionally using the CLS token for classification. The approach was more accidental than architectural.

### Improved Implementation

Our updated implementation makes the CLS token usage explicit:

```python
def forward(self, src):
    # src shape: [batch_size, seq_length]
    embedded = self.embedding(src) * math.sqrt(self.embed_dim)
    embedded = self.pos_encoder(embedded)
    
    # Transformer expects [seq_length, batch_size, embed_dim]
    transformer_input = embedded.permute(1, 0, 2)
    transformer_output = self.transformer_encoder(transformer_input)
    
    # Get the CLS token representation (first token)
    # transformer_output shape: [seq_length, batch_size, embed_dim]
    cls_representation = transformer_output[0]  # CLS token is at position 0
    
    # Pass through the classification layer
    logits = self.fc_out(cls_representation)
    return logits
```

## Benefits of Proper CLS Implementation

1. **Architectural Clarity**: Makes it explicit that we're following BERT's design philosophy
2. **Better Representation**: CLS token is specifically designed to capture sequence-level information
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Clearer code that better communicates intent
4. **Potential Performance Gains**: Proper use of the token designed for classification

## Integration Notes

- No changes to training, testing, or inference code are needed
- The CLS token is already added by the BERT tokenizer by default
- After updating the model, it needs to be retrained to capture the proper CLS token dynamics
