# Enhanced Transformer Classifier

This repository contains an improved implementation of a simple transformer-based text classifier built with PyTorch. The project features several significant enhancements to both the model architecture and training methodology that address common challenges in deep learning.

## Key Improvements

### Model Architecture Enhancements

The transformer model architecture has been improved with several regularization and stabilization techniques:

- **Increased Dropout Rate (0.3)**: Higher dropout probability helps prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping" more neurons during training.
- **Layer Normalization**: Added to stabilize the learning process and address the internal covariate shift problem.
- **GELU Activation Function**: Replaced implicit activation with explicit Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation, which tends to perform better than ReLU in transformer architectures.
- **Enhanced Forward Pass**: Modified to include proper normalization, activation, and dropout sequence for more stable gradient flow.

### Training Pipeline Improvements

The training process has been completely overhauled with modern best practices:

- **Validation Monitoring**: Added separate validation step to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Early Stopping**: Implemented patience-based early stopping to prevent overfitting and unnecessary computation.
- **L2 Regularization**: Added weight decay (1e-4) to the Adam optimizer to further combat overfitting.
- **Improved Model Saving Strategy**: Now saves the best model based on validation performance rather than just the final model.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks both loss and accuracy on validation data for better performance assessment.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Plots training and validation losses together to easily identify overfitting patterns.

## Usage

```python
# Example usage with the improved model
from model import SimpleTransformerClassifier

# Initialize model
model = SimpleTransformerClassifier(
    vocab_size=10000,
    embed_dim=256,
    num_heads=8,
    num_layers=4,
    num_classes=3,
    max_seq_length=100,
    dropout=0.3  # Increased dropout for better regularization
)

# Training uses improved pipeline with validation and early stopping
# See train.py for details
```

## Performance Comparison

The enhanced model achieves better generalization and more stable training compared to the previous version. Key benefits include:

- Reduced overfitting through multiple regularization techniques
- Faster convergence due to normalization and improved gradient flow
- More reliable model selection via validation-based early stopping
- Better overall accuracy on unseen data

## Requirements

- PyTorch >= 1.8.0
- matplotlib
- tqdm

## Future Work

- Experiment with different learning rate schedules
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
- Add data augmentation techniques specific to text classification
