## Notes on Performance Comparisons

When comparing the custom transformer results (~75% accuracy) with these benchmark studies, it's important to note:

1. **Pre-training Impact**: The main advantage of BERT and RoBERTa comes from their pre-training on massive text corpora (books, Wikipedia, web text)

2. **Parameter Efficiency**: Despite having fewer parameters (4-28M vs. 110M+ for BERT-base), the performance gap shows the value of transfer learning

3. **Training Data Efficiency**: Pre-trained models can achieve high performance with fewer fine-tuning examples

4. **Computational Trade-offs**: The performance advantage of larger models comes with significantly higher computational requirements for both training and inference
